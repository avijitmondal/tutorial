JEP 341 Default CDS Archives
This enhances the JDK build process to generate a class data-sharing (CDS) archive,
using the default class list, on 64-bit platforms. The goal is to improve startup time.
From Java 12, CDS is by default ON.

To run your program with CDS turned off do the following:


java -Xshare:off HelloWorld.java
Now, this would delay the startup time of the program.
