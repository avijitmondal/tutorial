ZGC: Uncommit Unused Memory
This JEP has enhanced ZGC to return unused heap memory to the operating system.
The Z Garbage Collector was introduced in Java 11. It adds a short pause time before
the heap memory cleanup. But, the unused memory was not being returned to the operating system.
This was a concern for devices with small memory footprint such as IoT and microchips.
Now, it has been enhanced to return the unused memory to the operating system.
