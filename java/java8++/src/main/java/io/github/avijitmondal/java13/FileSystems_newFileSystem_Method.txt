FileSystems.newFileSystem() Method

Three new methods have been added to the FileSystems class to make it easier to use
file system providers, which treats the contents of a file as a file system.

1. newFileSystem(Path)
2. newFileSystem(Path, Map<String, ?>)
3. newFileSystem(Path, Map<String, ?>, ClassLoader)
