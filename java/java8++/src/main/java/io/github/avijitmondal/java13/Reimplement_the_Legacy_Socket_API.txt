Reimplement the Legacy Socket API â€“ JEP 353

The underlying implementation of the java.net.Socket and java.net.ServerSocket APIs
have been rewritten. The new implementation, NioSocketImpl, is a drop-in replacement for PlainSocketImpl.

It uses java.util.concurrent locks rather than synchronized methods.
If you want to use the legacy implementation, use the java option -Djdk.net.usePlainSocketImpl.
