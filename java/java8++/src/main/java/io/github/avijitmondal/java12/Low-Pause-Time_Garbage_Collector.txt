Shenandoah: A Low-Pause-Time Garbage Collector (Experimental)

RedHat initiated Shenandoah Garbage Collector to reduce GC pause times.
The idea is to run GC concurrently with the running Java threads.

It aims at consistent and predictable short pauses irrelevant of the heap size.
So it does not matter if the heap size is 15 MB or 15GB.

It is an experimental feature in Java 12.
